/**
 * basic types of C and definitions which types are compatible
 *
 * extended by alternative types with variability: CChoice
 */

/**
 * Missing from used formalization:
 *
 * We omit the following features of C's type system: enumeration types,
 * the type qualifiers const and volatile, bit-elds, and union types. Furthermore
 * we do not allow functions to take variable numbers of arguments,
 * and we also gloss over the typedef construct, assuming that this last facility
 * is compiled out in such a way that occurrences of type identifiers are
 * replaced with the type that they abbreviate.
 *
 * Our treatment of functions and array types as function parameters is
 * different from that in the standard. In the case of functions, the standard
 * makes use of what it terms pointers to functions. These are essentially
 * variables that can contain references to functions, where possible values
 * are all of the program's dened functions. This is how we shall treat func
 * tion references henceforth, stripping them of the confusing semantic baggage
 * associated with pointers. (The language in the standard is continually
 * having to make exceptions for pointers to functions in its description of
 * operations on pointers. It is not possible to perform pointer arithmetic on
 * function references, and dereferencing of function pointers is an idempotent
 * operation.) This clarity of exposition will also be evident in the
 * discussion of the dynamic semantics. We will discuss the nature of array
 * types, and how our denition differs from that given in the standard in
 * section 2.3 below.
